# Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Validation: Maji Ndogo Agricultural Project

This Python notebook focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization phase of the **Maji Ndogo Agricultural Project**, where data is examined to uncover meaningful insights and validate its accuracy. The analysis leverages **Seaborn**, a powerful Python visualization library, to illustrate relationships between variables critical to agricultural decision-making, such as **rainfall**, **pH levels**, and **temperature**.

### Objective:
The primary goal of this notebook is twofold:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: To visually represent data trends and relationships, providing insights into the environmental conditions affecting agriculture in Maji Ndogo.
2. **Data Validation**: To compare farm-based environmental data with weather station data to ensure the accuracy and reliability of measurements. This process is essential for building a trustworthy foundation for further analysis and decision-making.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
The EDA section uses **Seaborn** to create a range of visualizations, including:
- **Scatter plots** to highlight relationships between variables like rainfall and crop yield.
- **Line graphs** to track changes in temperature over time.
- **Heatmaps** to identify correlations between multiple environmental factors.

These visualizations allow stakeholders to identify patterns that may influence agricultural productivity, helping to inform decisions on crop placement and farming strategies.

### Data Validation:
Accurate data is critical for making informed decisions. This notebook includes a thorough validation process, comparing key environmental variables (such as temperature, pH, and rainfall) from the farm datasets with data from five nearby **weather stations** in Maji Ndogo. Each farm field is associated with the closest weather station, enabling the comparison of measurements and ensuring consistency.

The validation step is vital for confirming the reliability of the dataset before it is used in downstream analysis, including predictive modeling or decision-making. Data integrity is particularly important in agricultural projects where environmental factors directly impact the success of farming practices.

### Key Tasks:
- **Visualize Data**: Generate visual representations of the relationships between key agricultural and environmental variables.
- **Compare and Validate Data**: Compare field-level measurements with those from nearby weather stations to validate the accuracy of farm data.
- **Gain Insights**: Understand the conditions under which crops like tea thrive, and identify potential mismatches between crop location and environmental suitability.

The outputs from this notebook provide a solid foundation for further analysis, ensuring that the data is both clean and accurate, and that the visualizations offer actionable insights for optimizing agricultural strategies in Maji Ndogo.
